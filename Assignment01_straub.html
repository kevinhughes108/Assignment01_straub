<p>
    My experience with HTML and CSS mostly comes from WRA 210. I am comfortable with using sources
    and references to build HTML and CSS documents, but I am far from proficient. In my accessibility
    internship with MSU Libraries, I often studied the accessibility of the source code of websites, 
    so that gave me some insight into using HTML for important things like alt text and proper heading
    hierarchy.

<p>
   From this class, I hope to better understand the systems behind HTML and CSS. Rather than copying
   and pasting source code, I would like to be able to come up with my own solutions. Although I do not
   plan to go into web development, as a UX designer, it will certainly be helpful to have a solid
   foundation of HTML and CSS when it comes time to work with developers.
